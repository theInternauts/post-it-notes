post-it-notes
=============
experiments with DOM manipulation, OO JS, and data models
(currently using Backbone.js)


[Live Demo] (http://theinternauts.github.io/post-it-notes/)

ToDo: 
+ Serialize data storage schema
+ Choose a server-side platform (Node.js? Rails?)


##Roadmap
(in no particular order)
+ ~~header labels~~
+ ~~include postIt location data in the data model~~
+ ~~ensure bi-directional model/view syncing~~
+ ~~Need to re-tool with Backbone~~
+ UI design overhaul
+ Needs a ~MASSIVE~ refactor.  The MainBoard, PostIt and PostItGroup are almost the exact same thing.  I can DRY this up
+ Groups of notes on a single board
+ major canvas zooming capability for an *"infinite board"*
+ named groups
+ Photo notes
+ Video notes
+ needs a proper demo page
+ persistent storage (local)
+ persistent storage (server)
+ Oauth sign in with Google
+ Oauth sign in with Twitter
+ Oauth sign in with Facebook
+ multiple boards (collections of post-its)
+ named boards
+ consider Firebase for real-time collaboration
+ package this app as a Google Chrome extension that stores your data in the cloud
