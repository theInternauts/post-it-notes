PostObject = { header: "", content: "", id: "", position: { top: "", left: "" } }

PostGroupObject = { name: "", list: [ ], id: "", position: { top: "", left: "" } }


Not sure how to model Groups yet -- a Group Model and another Collection?



Also don't forget to search for event Delegation in the PDF  (it's not what i want it to be :( )


main:	collection,add,remove,

group:	collection,add,remove,position,header,dimension,


the big questions:
namspacing with Require.js?  //not sure I actually need this anymore.  Require does it for me?
jquery-ui with require.js?   require( ['backbone', 'jquery', 'jquery-ui'], function( backbone, $ ){ })
