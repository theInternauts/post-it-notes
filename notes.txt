PostObject = { header: "", content: "", id: "", position: { top: "", left: "" } }

PostGroupObject = { name: "", list: [ ], id: "", position: { top: "", left: "" } }


MainBoard need a collection of all PostIt's

Not sure how to model Groups yet -- a Group Model and another Collection?



Also don't forget to search for event Delegation in the PDF  (it's not what i want it to be :( )
